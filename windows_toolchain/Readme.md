# Explicitly declare autodetected C++ toolchain when compiling on Windows

## Goal

Show how to explicitly declare the C++ toolchain that is automatically detected by Bazel and used to compile by default on Windows.

## About the example

In this example we will see how we can explicitly declare a C++ toolchain in Bazel taking as a reference the toolchain automatically generated.

Currently in Bazel there are two ways to use toolchains, one is with `--cpu`, `--crosstool_top` and `--compiler`, and the other one is using platforms.
The first way is complex, lacks flexibility and it is planned to be deprecated, the second one will replace the first one.
Because of this, in this example we will show how to use toolchains building with platforms.

### Bazel toolchains

In order to have an easy and fast start, Bazel provies an automatic detection of toolchains.
It detects which compilers are available in your system and configures automatically the C++ toolchains.
In case of C++, a toolchain is composed mainly by compiler, linker, compiler flags, linker flags, system include directories, and library directories.

### Obtain the default generted toolchain

The first think that we need to do, is to know which toolchain Bazel is using to compile C++ and where to find it.
To do that we can build any target specifying the option `--toolchain_resolution_debug=.*`.

```bash
bazel build --toolchain_resolution_debug=.* //:hello_world
```

When doing that we will see in the logs which toolchain Bazel decided to use.
Not all toolchains that appear in the log are used, we need to pay special attention to the part that says `Selected toolchain` in the logs starting with `INFO: ToolchainResolution:`.

```bash
INFO: ToolchainResolution:     Type @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type: target platform @local_config_platform//:host: Rejected toolchain @local_config_cc//:cc-compiler-armeabi-v7a; mismatching values: arm, android
INFO: ToolchainResolution:   Type @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type: target platform @local_config_platform//:host: execution @local_config_platform//:host: Selected toolchain @local_config_cc//:cc-compiler-x64_windows
INFO: ToolchainResolution: Target platform @local_config_platform//:host: Selected execution platform @local_config_platform//:host, type @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type -> toolchain @local_config_cc//:cc-compiler-x64_windows
INFO: ToolchainResolution: Target platform @local_config_platform//:host: Selected execution platform @local_config_platform//:host,
INFO: ToolchainResolution: Target platform @local_config_platform//:host: Selected execution platform @local_config_platform//:host,
```

In this case the relevant line is the one that contains `Selected toolchain @local_config_cc//:cc-compiler-x64_windows` and it is telling us that the toolchain selected
is `@local_config_cc//:cc-compiler-x64_windows`.
We need to keep in mind that the toolchain selected might depend on what is installed on the computer and what operating system you are using.

Now that we know what toolchain has been used, the next step is to take it as a reference to create our own toolchain.
The good part of the autogenerated toolchain is that exist in the file system inside the bazel generated folders and we can take it almost as is.

Let's take it:

* Create a folder called `toolchain` that is where we will store our toolchain.
* Copy the content of `bazel-windows_toolchain/external/local_config_cc` except the `WORKSPACE` file, inside the `toolchain` folder that you just created.

### Make sure that the autogenerated toolchain is not used

Before proceeding with the configuration of our new toolchain that we just copied, we want to make sure that Bazel does not use the autogenerated one.
To do that we can define the environment variable `BAZEL_DO_NOT_DETECT_CPP_TOOLCHAIN=1`.
In addition we also want to use the new way to work with toolchains, for that we can use `--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution`.

Let's see what happens when we build our target with this options:

```bash
bazel build //:hello_world --toolchain_resolution_debug --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution --action_env=BAZEL_DO_NOT_DETECT_CPP_TOOLCHAIN=1
INFO: Invocation ID: 40a879bb-a931-4bdb-9af5-d20d72f1796d
INFO: Build option --action_env has changed, discarding analysis cache.
INFO: ToolchainResolution:   Type @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type: target platform @local_config_platform//:host: No toolchains found.
ERROR: While resolving toolchains for target //:hello_world: No matching toolchains found for types @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type. Maybe --incompatible_use_cc_configure_from_rules_cc has been flipped and
there is no default C++ toolchain added in the WORKSPACE file? See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10134 for details and migration instructions.
ERROR: Analysis of target '//:hello_world' failed; build aborted: No matching toolchains found for types @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type. Maybe --incompatible_use_cc_configure_from_rules_cc has been flipped and there is no default C++ toolchain added in the WORKSPACE file? See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10134 for details and migration instructions.
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.869s
INFO: 0 processes.
FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (2 packages loaded, 97 targets configured)
```

The relevant line here is `ERROR: While resolving toolchains for target //:hello_world: No matching toolchains found for types @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type`.
As we wanted, Bazel is not able to compile anymore, because it cannot find the C++ toolchain.
That is good because with this way we are sure that does not take the autogenerated toolchain.

### Configuring our explicitly declared toolchain

If we look in the `BUILD` file that we just copied inside the `toolchain` folder, we will see that contains a `cc_toolchain` and a `cc_toolchain_suite` target. To be able to use the toolchain building with platforms, we need to add an additional target called `toolchain` that contains the following information:

* The toolchain to be used, needs to point to the `cc_toolchain` target, in this case `cc-compiler-x64_windows`
* The type of the toolchain, in this case C++
* The constraints of the platform where the toolchain will be executed
* The constraints of the platform that the toolchain is targeting. Meaning the platform where the code will be executed. In case that we would do cross-compilation then `exec_compatible_with` and `target_compatible_with` would be different.

The target that we need to add is as follows:

```bash
toolchain(
    name = "my_windows_toolchain",
    exec_compatible_with = [
        "@platforms//os:windows",
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
    target_compatible_with = [
        "@platforms//os:windows",
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
    toolchain = ":cc-compiler-x64_windows",
    toolchain_type = "@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type",
)
```

And now we are ready for the last step, that is to inform Bazel that the toolchain is available. To do that we need to register the toolchain in the `WORKSPACE` file (or in a .bzl file loaded in the `WORKSPACE` file).

```bash
register_toolchains(
    "//toolchain:my_windows_toolchain",
)
```

### Declaring the platform to be used

As we saw before, we might have two different platforms, one where the toolchain gets executed, and another one that is the target platform. If we want to be correct we should define the target platform and indicate it when we compile. If we do not do that, Bazel will assume that the target platform is the same like the host.

To declare the platform is pretty simple, we just need to create a `platform` target containing the constrains of our platform. In this case it is Windows on a x64 cpu.

To keep it structure, we put this target in a `BUILD` file in a `platform` folder:

```bash
platform(
    name = "windows_x64",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:windows",
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

### Compiling with the explicitly declared toolchain

Now that the toolchain is registered, and the platform is declared, we just need to compile specifying the target platform and Bazel will know which toolchain to use.

```bash
bazel build //:hello_world --toolchain_resolution_debug --platforms=//platform:windows_x64 --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution --action_env=BAZEL_DO_NOT_DETECT_CPP_TOOLCHAIN=1
Starting local Bazel server and connecting to it...
INFO: Invocation ID: 26d1680f-be65-4e1d-93b9-92e9be123824
INFO: ToolchainResolution:   Type @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type: target platform //platform:windows_x64: execution @local_config_platform//:host: Selected toolchain //toolchain:cc-compiler-x64_windows
INFO: ToolchainResolution: Target platform //platform:windows_x64: Selected execution platform @local_config_platform//:host, type @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain_type -> toolchain //toolchain:cc-compiler-x64_windows
INFO: ToolchainResolution: Target platform @local_config_platform//:host: Selected execution platform @local_config_platform//:host,
INFO: ToolchainResolution: Target platform //platform:windows_x64: Selected execution platform @local_config_platform//:host,
INFO: Analyzed target //:hello_world (21 packages loaded, 132 targets configured).
INFO: Found 1 target...
Target //:hello_world up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/hello_world.exe
INFO: Elapsed time: 67.487s, Critical Path: 1.97s
INFO: 6 processes: 4 internal, 2 local.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 6 total actions
```

Because the part of the command line `--action_env=BAZEL_DO_NOT_DETECT_CPP_TOOLCHAIN=1` and `--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` is something that we always want to do to make sure that we do not use anymore autmatically generated toolchains, we can extract it in the `.bazelrc` file.

And now we can build just doing:

```bash
bazel build //:hello_world --platforms=//platform:windows_x64
```

### Cleaning up the toolchain and next steps

At this point everything is working fine but there is some cleanup that we can do.
The automatic generated toolchain, contains indeed more than one toolchain but we do not use them all.
Also contains a target called `cc_toolchain_suite` that is used in case of using `--cpu` and `--crosstool_top`, but that is not our case. Because of that, we should clean our toolchain folder and remove all unused targets like the arm targets (`armeabi_cc_toolchain_config.bzl`), `cc_toolchain_suite`, and any other target that is not referenced.

Because the automatic generated toolchain assumes the possibility that the compiler could be `msvc` or `clang`, you can also remove all `clang` branches from `windows_cc_toolchain_config.bzl`.

Last but not least, I would also recommend that you apply buildifier to the files inside the toolchain folder. The automatically generated files are usually not properly formated.

### Wrapping up

Now you have an explicitly declared toolchain for Windows. The next step is to go over the files and understand them. Then you can adapt the toolchain to your needs, adding features or changing compiler flags. Once you understand them you will see that you can keep cleaning up and remove unneeded features.
