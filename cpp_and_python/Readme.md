# Basic example that combines Python and C++ to create a simple executable

## Goal

Show how you can use multiple programming languages to create an executable. It also demostrates how to create Bazel macros.

## About the example

The example is structured as follows:

* `//hello_world:generator`: A Python application (`py_binary`) that given a text file, generates a hello world C++ source file with the content of the input text file.

* `//hello_world:generator.bzl`: In this `bzl` file we define a macro called `hello_world`, and contains the glue code to invoke the `py_binary` mentioned above.

* `//:code_dive`, `//:ndc_techtown`, and `everyone`: Are instantiations of the `hello_world` macro. The input file is deduced from the target name.

* `//:hello_world_code_dive`, `//hello_world_ndc_techtown`, and `//:hello_world_everyone`: C++ binaries that use as a source file the C++ file generated by the Python application given the input file.

## How to try it out

To run the different executables you call:

```bash
bazel run //:hello_world_everyone
bazel run //:hello_world_code_dive
bazel run //:hello_world_ndc_techtown
```

If you modify the content of the different `txt` files and you run them again, you will see that the output displayed to the terminal changes.

You can also just generate the C++ source file that is used to create the executable as follows:

```bash
bazel build //:everyone
bazel build //:code_dive
bazel build //:ndc_techtown
```
